We're looking for a Senior Backend Developer to join our dream team and help us release the best, most innovative products across our mobile and AI platforms.\
If you’re passionate about building scalable APIs, experimenting with AI models, and bringing\
machine learning to production, this role is for you.\
\
**How will you make a difference?**\
● You have a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Data Engineering, or a\
related field.\
● You have 5+ years of experience developing robust, scalable backend applications and APIs.\
● You’re eager to expand your skill set into AI engineering, working with pre-trained models and data pipelines rather than pure research.\
● You have experience with Python (Flask, FastAPI, or Google Cloud Functions) and ideally\
Node.js / TypeScript for cross-project collaboration.\
● You are familiar with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services used for backend and AI\
workflows: Cloud Functions, Firestore, Secret Manager, Compute Engine, BigQuery, etc.\
● You understand or have hands-on experience with machine learning pipelines: downloading\
and evaluating models from Kaggle, performing basic fine-tuning, and applying feature\
engineering to improve model performance.\
\
**What will you do?**\
● Oversee and improve backend applications and APIs that power mobile and AI-based\
products.\
● Maintain and evolve serverless APIs (Google Cloud Functions) that orchestrate AI model\
execution, translation, and quota tracking.\
● Fetch, benchmark, and integrate AI models from Kaggle, Hugging Face, or other sources into production pipelines.\
● Apply feature engineering and data preprocessing to enhance model performance and\
reliability.

● Define and track metrics to evaluate backend and model health (performance, stability,\
latency, quality).\
● Collaborate closely with Product, AI, and Mobile teams to design APIs and deliver features\
that merge machine learning with real-world applications.\
● Develop reusable backend tools and shared components for use across multiple products.\
● Ensure backend systems remain secure, scalable, and well-documented.\
● Contribute to a strong team culture of learning, collaboration, and technical excellence.\
\
**Your team**\
● We’re team-first. If you believe in the power of collaboration and that the team’s success is\
your success, then you’re one of us!\
● Fun is fundamental. We believe in forming strong bonds in and outside the office. That’s why we have a team-building budget and organize activities to enjoy ourselves\
● Positivity wins the day. Bring a positive attitude and communicate openly. Self-awareness\
and an openness to learn are always a plus
