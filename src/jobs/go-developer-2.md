* We expect candidate to produce solid volume of code, including tests. Sometimes need to think more before start to do something, but routine tasks such as documentation and writing of the tests is required in our team
* We expect understanding of estimating your work from the point of time. It’s important for big projects and big implementations to follow final goal and be ready to solve it

**We offer**

* You will get freedom to show your technical and architecture ambitions, and eventually be rewarded for it, however until you’ll be fully confident - you’ll get support
* Projects will be challenging and you can grow up there for any level you would like
* We also aim to expand our client-base with Rust-projects in future. Our goal is to provide complex back-end services with full end-to-end pipeline, deploying, clustering, monitoring, architecture and implementation, for projects with high level of difficulty
